Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task.
 It involves training software, known as a model, to identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make useful predictions or generate new content such as text, images, or audio.
 Unlike traditional programming, where specific instructions are provided, machine learning allows computers to improve their performance over time by learning from experience and data.

The core idea is that a machine "learns" by analyzing data, adjusting its internal parameters to reduce prediction errors, and refining its ability to perform tasks through repeated iterations.
 This learning process is driven by data, which serves as the foundation for training models and enabling them to generalize to new, unseen data.

There are three main types of machine learning:

Supervised learning uses labeled data—where each input has a known correct output—to train models for tasks like regression (predicting numerical values) or classification (categorizing data).
 For example, a model can learn to predict house prices based on features like size and location, or classify emails as spam or not spam.
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, where the model identifies hidden patterns, structures, or groupings on its own, such as clustering similar data points or reducing data dimensions.
 This is useful for discovering insights in large datasets where labels are unavailable.
Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones, thereby learning a strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
 This approach is commonly used in robotics and game-playing AI.
A newer and rapidly evolving category is generative AI, which creates new content—like text, images, or music—by learning patterns from existing data and mimicking them.
 These models can generate unique outputs based on user input, such as producing a poem from a single sentence or creating a realistic image from a description.

Machine learning powers many modern technologies, including language translation, image recognition, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and voice assistants.
 It is particularly valuable for solving complex problems that are difficult to program explicitly, such as understanding natural language, diagnosing diseases from medical images, or detecting fraud in financial transactions.
 The performance of ML models improves with more data and experience, making them adaptable and self-improving over time.

Key components of the machine learning process include data input, algorithm selection, model training, feedback loops for error correction, and evaluation on unseen data to ensure generalization.
 Effective data preparation—handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting data into training and testing sets—is crucial for building accurate models.
 Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, k-means clustering, and neural networks.
